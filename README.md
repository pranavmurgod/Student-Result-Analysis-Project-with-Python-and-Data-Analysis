# Student Result Analysis Project
## Overview
This project focuses on exploring and visualizing various aspects of student performance, such as gender, parental education, marital status, and ethnic groups. The aim is to gain insights into how different factors influence student results and present them in a meaningful and visual way.

By conducting data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and outlier detection, I demonstrate my skills in handling real-world datasets and performing detailed analysis using Python. The project highlights my ability to process raw data into actionable insights—essential for business decision-making.

Getting Started
To replicate or run the analysis, install the following libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
You'll also need the dataset, stored in a CSV file named Expanded_data_with_more_features.csv.

## Data Overview
The dataset contains various details about students, including gender, ethnicity, parental education, test preparation, and their scores in math, reading, and writing. These attributes allow for deep exploration of potential correlations between demographic factors and academic performance.

## Data Cleaning
Initial steps involve:

Removing the unnecessary "Unnamed: 0" column.
Handling missing values to ensure the dataset is clean and ready for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key analyses include:
1. Gender Distribution: A visual breakdown of male and female students.
2. Parental Education: Analyzing its impact on students’ scores.
3. Parental Marital Status: Exploring any correlation between marital status and student performance.

## Outlier Detection
Box plots were utilized to identify outliers in math, reading, and writing scores, which could signal anomalies or data worth further investigation.

## Ethnic Group Distribution
Ethnic Groups: Grouped students by ethnicity (Group A to Group E), with visualizations (pie charts and bar plots) to show the proportion of students in each group.
Numerical Column Distribution
Violin plots were used to visualize the distribution of numerical columns such as math, reading, and writing scores, providing a more detailed view of score variance.

## Key Insights
1. Parental Education: A positive correlation between higher parental education and student performance was observed.
2. Marital Status: Little impact on student scores, suggesting that other factors may be more influential.
3. Ethnic Groups: Most students belong to ethnic groups C and D.
4. Math Scores: Identified as having more outliers compared to reading and writing, indicating math may pose more challenges for students.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improving the analysis or new features, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.

## Project Workflow
1. Data Selection: Dataset related to student performance.
2. Data Transformation: Cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values.
3. Outlier Detection: Box plot visualizations were used for identifying outliers.
4. Visualization: Seaborn and Matplotlib were used for creating various plots (e.g., pie charts, violin plots, count plots).
5. Insights: Data exploration led to findings about parental education, gender distribution, and performance differences across ethnic groups.
   
## Summary
This project showcases my ability to perform an end-to-end data analysis, from cleaning to generating insights. It highlights my experience in data analysis, visualization, and insight communication—critical skills for any aspiring Business Analyst.
